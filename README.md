Project description:

CoronaBook is applacation trargeted at connecting and transporting medical materials to where are needed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the rapid spread of the virus hospitals and medical centers struggle to provide and have the necessary materials needed to help the patients. That is why with our website hospitals and pharmacies input the amount of stock they have and are able to ask and give other medical centers for materials. That way the community is able to support and help to “flatten the curve”. Another goal is to help anyone facing an economic struggle by providing them with a free online store. Anyone can post items that they do not want and want to donate (all anonymously) and an individual facing economic struggle and contact them through an anonymous private chat to exchange the items. That way we are able to provide people in need with materials through social distancing rules and in an efficient way.
